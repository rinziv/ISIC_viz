                            Skin cancer is the most common cancer globally, with melanoma being the most deadly form.
                            Dermoscopy is a skin imaging modality that has demonstrated improvement for diagnosis of
                            skin
                            cancer compared to unaided visual inspection. However, clinicians should receive adequate
                            training for those improvements to be realized. In order to make expertise more widely
                            available, opaque artificial intelligence models need to go along with detailed and
                            trustworthy
                            explanations.

                            This web application shows the result of an AI-based system that suggests a classification
                            for a
                            dermoscopic image. Beside the outcome of the system, we present a series of images that
                            serve as
                            explanation for the decision of the AI System: a counter example image, that shows an
                            example
                            that the AI system classifies with a different label; and a set of 4 prototypes showing
                            images
                            with the same classification as the original one.

                    <h4>Skin cancer descriptions</h4>
                    <p><strong>Melanoma</strong>: is a type of skin cancer taht developes from the pigment-producing cells known as
                        melanocytes. Often Melanoma developes from moles: Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma
                        include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown.</p>
                    <p><strong>Melanocytic nevus</strong>: is a type of melanocytic tumor that contains nevus cells. The most common
                        types of moles are skin tags, raised moles and flat moles. Benign moles are usually brown, tan,
                        pink or black (especially on dark-colored skin). They are circular or oval and are usually small
                        (commonly between 1â€“3 mm), though some can be larger than the size of a typical pencil eraser
                        (>5 mm).</p>

                    <p><strong>Basal cell carcinoma</strong>: is the most common type of skin cancer. It often appears as a painless
                        raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it. Basal-cell
                        carcinoma typically present with a shiny, pearly skin nodule.</p>

                    <p><strong>Actinic keratosis</strong>: is a pre-cancerous area of thick, scaly, or crusty skin. Size commonly ranges
                        between 2 and 6 millimeteres, but they can grow to be several centimeters in diameter. Notably,
                        AKs are often felt before they are seen, and the texture is sometimes compared to sandpaper.
                        They may be dark, light, tan, pink, red, a combination of all these, or have the same color as
                        the surrounding skin.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dermatofibroma</strong>: is a benign skin growth. Dermatofibromas are hard solitary slow-growing papules
                        that may appear in a variety of colours, usually brownish to tan; they are often elevated or
                        pedunculated.</p>

                    <p><strong>Vascular lesion</strong>: is any medical condition that affects the integumentary system - the organ
                        system that encloses the body and includes the skin, hair, nails, and related muscle and glands.
                        They are relatively common abnormalities of the skin and underlying tissues, more commonly known
                        as birthmarks.</p>
